# Icon Set for the Chronus

Icon set for the Cronus weather widget. This is an updated version of the Sample_Icon_Set which can be found on GitHub. It updates that project to use gradle and updated the icons in accordance with the new weather codes which are below. (The app is not using the new codes so I merged the two together, some of the providers do not work correctly with the codes but I cannot fix these problems).

Icons made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect" title="Pixel perfect">Pixel perfect</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/"             title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"             title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a> with edits to some of the icons made by me.
